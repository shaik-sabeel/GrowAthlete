# SPA Routing Fix - 404 Error on Refresh

## Problem
You're experiencing 404 errors when refreshing pages in your React Single Page Application (SPA). This happens because hosting services don't know how to handle client-side routes by default.

## Solution Applied

I've created comprehensive redirect configurations for multiple hosting platforms:

### 1. Vercel (vercel.json)
- Updated with proper rewrite rules
- Excludes API routes from SPA handling
- Added cache control headers

### 2. Netlify (netlify.toml + _redirects)
- Added comprehensive redirect configuration
- Included build settings and security headers
- Created _redirects file for compatibility

### 3. Apache (.htaccess)
- Created for Apache-based hosting services
- Handles client-side routing with mod_rewrite

### 4. Nginx (nginx.conf)
- Created for Nginx-based hosting services
- Includes static asset caching and security headers

### 5. Vite Configuration
- Added historyApiFallback for development
- Enhanced preview server configuration

## Files Created/Updated

### Configuration Files:
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `frontend/public/netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- `frontend/public/_redirects` - Netlify redirects
- `frontend/public/.htaccess` - Apache configuration
- `frontend/public/nginx.conf` - Nginx configuration
- `frontend/vite.config.js` - Updated Vite configuration

### Fallback Files:
- `frontend/public/fallback.html` - Fallback page for any hosting service

## How to Deploy

### For Vercel:
1. Your `vercel.json` is already configured
2. Deploy normally - Vercel will automatically use the configuration

### For Netlify:
1. Your `netlify.toml` and `_redirects` files are ready
2. Deploy normally - Netlify will use these configurations

### For Other Hosting Services:
1. **Apache**: Upload the `.htaccess` file to your public directory
2. **Nginx**: Use the `nginx.conf` configuration in your server setup
3. **Any other service**: The `_redirects` file should work for most static hosting services

## Testing the Fix

1. Deploy your application
2. Navigate to any route (e.g., `/about`, `/events`)
3. Refresh the page - it should work without 404 errors
4. Test direct URL access (paste a deep link in a new tab)

## Additional Notes

- Your React app already has a fallback route handler for undefined routes
- The configurations include security headers for better protection
- Static assets are properly cached for better performance
- API routes are excluded from SPA handling to prevent conflicts

## If Issues Persist

1. Check which hosting service you're using
2. Verify the correct configuration file is being used
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check hosting service documentation for SPA routing requirements

The 404 error on refresh should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
